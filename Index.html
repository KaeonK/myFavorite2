    <p> My favorite hobby is playing music on my keyboard. I also love singing songs in English and Italian. l play music in my free time. I am learning how to play sheet music and all the major and minor scales. I play music from the Renaissance period and music from the early 19th century. I also play old Disney songs. My favorite song is Ludwig van Beethoven’s ‘Ode to Joy’, which is the anthem of the European Union. I want to keep learning and improving my skills. I want to perform in front of an audience. </p>
